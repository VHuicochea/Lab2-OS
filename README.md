# Lab2

This C Shell was created by Victor Huicochea and Luis Gutierrez for CS 4375.

This program is a custom shell for the Unix system. This program mimics some of the behaviors of the bash shell. Our shell prints a prompt string specified by the by shell variable PS1 when expecting a command. The default prompt is '$'but can be changed with the command 'chprmpr. Our shell accepts the standard unix command shell syntax for specifying commands and parameters. Our shell handles expected user error by using printing statements. It also supports the use of simple pipes ex.) ls | sort -r. Our shell provides the follwowing built-in commands: 

cd,
exit,
chprmpt
